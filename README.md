# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to see how many employees were up for retirement per title and department. As well as see who is eligible for the mentorship program. This was determined by analizing those born between 1952 and 1955. 
### Results
* Almost 2,000 employees would be able to join the mentorship program. 
* Most titles were upper level employees and of those, they were close to retirement
* 30% of employees will be retiring soon. 
* It would be smart to look at traing those who below the senior level positions to assume the roles that will soon be left open. 
### Summary 
There will be just over 90 thousdand roles that will need to be filled within the next years. Without these roles filled, it will make a huge gap in employment. Especially the specific workers as they hold high up positions. It is important that there be an increase in training for lower level employees in hopes to move them into open positions when they become open. 

Personal Note:
I had a hard time understanding errors that occurred in the upload process. This challenge was not easy for me whatsoever and plan on discussing with a tutor.
